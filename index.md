### Day 1: May 9th, 2025
we landed at Taoyuan International Airport early in the morning, and my grandpa and his brother picked us up. After we arrived at our home and settled in, we had a quick breakfast before my aunt and uncle arrived. My aunt and mother prepared lunch, and after we ate, we went to Costco. Tawianese Costco was quite interesting, but exactly what I expected. It was a pretty boring shopping trip, as the pace was slow and the haul was mid. The jet-lag was starting to slowly hit, and arriving home, I had to fight my demons not to fall asleep. We ate dinner together, and I showered immediately after and prepared for bed.
